#explanation of all configuration :
#    host : the ip on which the server is listening : 127.0.0.1 if local, 0.0.0.0 by default and to listen to all.
#	port : default 80.Wrote on the same line as the host on the nignx configuration. We may not do that
#	server_names : to differentiate all the servers listening on the ip
#make	default error page : pages returned on an error
#	limit clien height body : self explanatory
#	routes : 
#		list of accepted http methods : other methods will be returned a forbidden error
#		http redirection : redirection to another page with a code of 3XX
#		root : the path /test will be search at root/test
#		directory listing : list the content of a directory
#		default file for directory : If directory listing is enabled, shows the content, otherwise, an error page
#		execute cgi based on file extension with POST and GET : when one of those methods ask for a file with the
#			extension, execute the script in a fork and execve.
#		make the route accept uploaded files : Create a route, accepting POST, that create a new file with the body content
#		configure where they should be saved : same thing as root in a route
#		do you wonder what cgi is : see cgi.txt
