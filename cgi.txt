CGI stands for Common Gateway Interface.
It allows the server to execute script, with execve, and in a fork.
It can execute any languages, but they has to be installed in the server side,
and, if they need one, the interpreter need to be written at the file start : #!/bin/bash
These executables should be in a restricted folder to prevent security breach.
An user should be modifying, adding a script.
We can also execute differents executable, based on the file extension
